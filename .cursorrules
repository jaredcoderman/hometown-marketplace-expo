# Cursor Rules for Hometown Marketplace

## Changelog Maintenance
- After completing significant features, improvements, or bug fixes, update `CHANGELOG.md` with generalized, high-level entries
- Group changes into: Features, Improvements, and Bug Fixes
- Keep entries concise and user-focused, not overly technical
- Add entries to the `[Unreleased]` section at the top of the changelog
- When asked to deploy or at the end of a session, remind about updating the changelog if needed

## Code Style
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Use React Native conventions
- Maintain consistency with existing codebase patterns

## Documentation
- Keep changes generalized in changelog - focus on user-facing impacts rather than technical details
- Update relevant documentation when adding new features
